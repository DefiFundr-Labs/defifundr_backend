# Blockchain Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the DefiFundr blockchain integration, covering private key management, transaction verification, gas limit protection, and smart contract security.

## Private Key Management

### Secure Storage
- Private keys are encrypted using AES-GCM encryption
- Keys are stored in a secure keystore with scrypt-based key derivation
- Minimum password length and complexity requirements enforced
- No plain-text private keys in memory or logs

### Key Access Control
- Role-based access control for key operations
- Audit logging for all key access attempts
- Automatic session timeouts
- Multi-factor authentication for key operations

## Transaction Security

### Transaction Verification
- Mandatory transaction signing verification
- Gas price validation against network recommendations
- Transaction parameter validation
- Nonce management and replay protection

### Gas Limit Protection
- Contract-specific gas limits
- Dynamic gas price adjustment
- Safety margin in gas estimation
- Maximum gas price caps

## Smart Contract Security

### Security Measures
- Access control implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Reentrancy protection
- Integer overflow/underflow protection
- Emergency pause functionality

### Security Auditing
- Regular smart contract audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Test coverage requirements
- Security patch management

## Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
1. Use established security patterns
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Follow secure coding standards
4. Regular security reviews

### Operational Security
1. Regular security assessments
2. Incident response planning
3. Backup and recovery procedures
4. Monitoring and alerting
